# Intro
*Hi Nikolaj*, I will add here below a list of besides work _things_ I've created. Not one of this projects is something complete, some of these are code challenges that touch upon particular topics, others are small apps I created to help me in a way or another, or simply to work with something I find interesting.

What I'd wish to outline from these projects is code, organization and technologies.
I think everyone of this projects is written in TypeScript, that's why it's not present anywhere in the technologies stack description.
