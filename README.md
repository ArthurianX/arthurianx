👋 Hi there!


![ArthurianX's GitHub stats](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api/?username=ArthurianX&show_icons=true&count_private=true&theme=vue)

🔭 I’m currently looking for work, my preferable unicorn could be:
- Series A/B startup
- Revenue, if not profit
- At least 1 year runway
- Cloud Platform / Web3 / Automation, the more environmentally / socially responsible the better
- [ShapeUp](https://basecamp.com/shapeup) product development
- Lot of responsbility, lots of stock, normal vesting period, possibly hardware

👷‍♂️ What value do I bring to the table:
- 15 years of experience in web development
- Broad knowledge about *a lot* of aspects of a product's lifecycle
- Main focus on frontend and mobile (code > pipeline > store), but really friendly with backend and DEVOPS as well
- Extensive experience with various tools, libraries, security, automation, external integrations
- Relentless problem solver
- Team player

My immediate value is in working with React-Native, React, Angular + TypeScript + all the popular libraries attached to them.
